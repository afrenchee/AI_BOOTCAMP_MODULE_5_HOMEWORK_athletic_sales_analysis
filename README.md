# AI_BOOTCAMP_PROJECT_5_athletic_sales_analysis

NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO "athletic_sales_analysis.ipynb"!!! All assignment requirements are in "from_scratch.py"!!!

REQUIREMENTS TO RUN CORRECTLY!!!

The variable windows_is_the_OS must be edited to either True or False!!! This variable is set by the main programmer to ensure that Terminal / Command Prompt commands are correctly executed in clear_screen() and end_program()

This program was designed to be used in the terminal on Mac / Linux, or the Command Prompt terminal equivelent in Windows.

This requires Python 3. "python3 from_scratch.py" will start the program.
